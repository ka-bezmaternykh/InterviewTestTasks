Greeting!

**Description of the task** \
Array of unique integers \
Create an array with unique numbers 1 - 100 000 in random order in it. \
Clarification: \
There should be a single (1) array created. \
The single array should have 100 000 elements in it. Each element should be an integer between 1 to 100 000. Each integer should be there only once (e.g. they should be unique). \
You don’t need to print out the array. I can just check it and the code using debugger.
